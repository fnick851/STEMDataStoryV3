            <span id="">I</span>n today’s era of technological innovation, students need to gain
            knowledge and skills in order to solve difficult problems, gather and evaluate evidence, and make sense of
            information they receive. Students
            can develop and strengthen these skills by studying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or
            STEM, subjects.<sup><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            STEM education is embedded in the U.S. Department of Education’s (the Department’s) mission. The Secretary
            of Education has outlined a
            <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/03/02/2018-04291/secretarys-final-supplemental-priorities-and-definitions-for-discretionary-grant-programs">
              comprehensive education agenda
            </a> that includes a focus on supporting projects that are designed to improve student achievement or other
            educational outcomes in one or more of the STEM areas, including expanding access to STEM and computer
            science courses for
            all students. Additionally, in September 2017, the President signed a
            <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-secretary-education/">
              Presidential Memorandum
            </a> designed to increase access to high-quality STEM education.
          </p>
          <p>
            While a number of different subjects fall under the STEM umbrella, Algebra I is the focus of this data
            story because it is seen as a gatekeeper course. A student must generally complete Algebra I in order to
            take higher level STEM courses.
          </p>
          <p>
            This data story explores both access to and enrollment in Algebra I in public schools using the 2015–16
            Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC).<sup><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The data
            story looks at the types of schools
            that offer Algebra I classes and further drills down to explore the students who actually enroll in these
            classes. While the Department is working to increase both access to and enrollment in STEM courses, as we
            will see through the story,
            students who have access to Algebra I classes do not necessarily enroll in them.

          <p>
            Taking Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade enables students to take a greater number and range of STEM
            courses than if they complete Algebra I in 9th grade or later because it is typically a prerequisite for
            more advanced courses.<sup><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></sup>

            A typical math course sequence would start with Algebra I and continue with Geometry, Algebra II,
            Pre-Calculus, and Calculus. Students who do not have access to Algebra I until high school will likely not

            Nearly 90 percent of students enrolled in magnet schools had access to Algebra I in 8th grade, compared to
            less than 20 percent of students enrolled in special education schools. This wide variation shows that
            students’ access to STEM education can be
            greatly impacted by the type of school they attend.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the benefits of taking high-level math courses, research also shows that students who
            completed Algebra I earlier completed a range of science courses by the end of high school.</a><sup><a href="#_ftn5"
                name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Since high-level mathematics and high-level science courses are
            frequently taken together, students who have the opportunity to take more advanced math courses are also
            more likely to take advanced science courses. However, some research shows
            a negative impact of universal 8th-grade Algebra policies on students’ math achievement in high school.<sup><a

            This map allows us to dig deeper to see the percentage of schools offering Algebra I in 8th grade in each
            district. Despite wide variations across the country, there are many states across the Northeast and along
            the Atlantic coast where a high percentage
            of students had access.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we will explore how access to Algebra I differs from enrollment in Algebra I in 8th grade.
          </p>

          <div class="acorn"><img src="assets/img/acorn.svg"></div>
          <h3>
            Enrollment lags behind access. Even when they can take Algebra I,
            many 8<sup>th</sup>-graders do not.
          </h3>
          <p>
            While access to Algebra I is important, access alone is not enough. Students will not reap the benefits of
            <em>access</em> to more STEM courses if they are not actually <em>enrolled</em> in the courses.
            Additionally, many states cite taking
            Algebra I classes (or passing Algebra I exams) as an outcome measure in their consolidated state plan,
            which describes how the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) will be implemented in their state.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many factors within a school that may impact how many, and which, students are ultimately
            enrolled in Algebra I in 8th grade.

            Previously, we saw that 80 percent of 8th-grade students had access to Algebra I in 8th grade; however,
            only 24 percent of 8th-grade students across the country were actually enrolled in the course. Furthermore,
            not all students were enrolled at the same
            rate. Asian students were the most likely to be enrolled (34 percent), compared to only 12 percent of black
            students. In addition, a slightly higher percentage of female students (25 percent) than male students (22
            percent) were enrolled in
            Algebra I in 8th grade.
          </p>
          <p>
            Research shows that students who enrolled in Algebra I in 8th grade had higher scores on math assessments
            at the end of the school year than 8th-graders who did not enroll in Algebra I. This was true for all
            students, regardless of student characteristics
            such as sex, race/ethnicity, poverty status, or mother’s education.<sup><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"

            Although over 8,000 districts offered access to Algebra I, in almost 90 percent of districts, less than
            half of all 8th-graders were enrolled in the course. We also see differences in enrollment by state, with
            Minnesota and Pennsylvania, for example,
            standing out as states with broad enrollment.

            We know that a strong STEM education is increasingly being recognized as a path to employment and that the
            need for STEM knowledge and skills will continue to grow in the future.<sup><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"
                title="">[8]</a></sup> Taking Algebra I in 8th grade can set students up for a strong foundation of
            STEM education and open the door for various college and career options in STEM. The data explored in this
            story highlight both successes and areas for improvement,
            as the Department, and districts across the country, work to ensure equal access to a strong STEM education
            for all students. The disparities found in both access and enrollment warrant closer examination and
            potential action by all STEM stakeholders.
