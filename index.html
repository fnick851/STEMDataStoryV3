            <span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n today’s era of technological innovation, students need to gain knowledge and skills in order to solve difficult problems, gather and evaluate evidence, and make sense of information they receive. Students
            can develop and strengthen these skills by studying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM, subjects.<sup><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            STEM education is embedded in the U.S. Department of Education’s (the Department’s) mission. The Secretary of Education has outlined a
            <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/03/02/2018-04291/secretarys-final-supplemental-priorities-and-definitions-for-discretionary-grant-programs">
              comprehensive education agenda
          </a> that includes a focus on supporting projects that are designed to improve student achievement or other educational outcomes in one or more of the STEM areas, including expanding access to STEM and computer science courses for
            all students. Additionally, in September 2017, the President signed a
            <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-secretary-education/">
              Presidential Memorandum
          </a> designed to increase access to high-quality STEM education.
          </p>
          <p>
            While a number of different subjects fall under the STEM umbrella, Algebra I is the focus of this data story because it is seen as a gatekeeper course. A student must generally complete Algebra I in order to take higher level STEM courses.
          </p>
          <p>
            This data story explores both access to and enrollment in Algebra I in public schools using the 2015–16 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC).<sup><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The data story looks at the types of schools
            that offer Algebra I classes and further drills down to explore the students who actually enroll in these classes. While the Department is working to increase both access to and enrollment in STEM courses, as we will see through the story,
            students who have access to Algebra I classes do not necessarily enroll in them.

          <p>
            Taking Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade enables students to take a greater number and range of STEM courses than if they complete Algebra I in 9th grade or later because it is typically a prerequisite for more advanced courses.<sup><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></sup>

              Schools that offer Algebra I in 8th grade provide their students with an opportunity to reach more advanced math and science courses in high school. However, there is a wide variation in students’ access to Algebra I in 8th grade based on the type of

            This map allows us to dig deeper to see the percentage of schools offering Algebra I in 8th grade in each district. Despite wide variations across the country, there are many states across the Northeast and along the Atlantic coast where a high percentage
            of students had access.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we will explore how access to Algebra I differs from enrollment in Algebra I in 8th grade.

          Enrollment lags behind access. Even when they have access to Algebra I,
          many 8th-graders are not enrolled.
      </h3>
          <p>
            While access to Algebra I is important, access alone is not enough. Students will not reap the benefits of <em>access</em> to more STEM courses if they are not actually <em>enrolled</em> in the courses. Additionally, many states cite taking
            Algebra I classes (or passing Algebra I exams) as an outcome measure in their consolidated state plan, which describes how the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) will be implemented in their state.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many factors within a school that may impact how many, and which, students are ultimately enrolled in Algebra I in 8th grade.

            Previously, we saw that 80 percent of 8th-grade students had access to Algebra I in 8th grade; however, only 24 percent of 8th-grade students across the country were actually enrolled in the course. Furthermore, not all students were enrolled at the same
            rate. Asian students were the most likely to be enrolled (34 percent), compared to only 12 percent of black students. In addition, a slightly higher percentage of female students (25 percent) than male students (22 percent) were enrolled in
            Algebra I in 8th grade.
          </p>
          <p>
            Research shows that students who enrolled in Algebra I in 8th grade had higher scores on math assessments at the end of the school year than 8th-graders who did not enroll in Algebra I. This was true for all students, regardless of student characteristics

            standing out as states with broad enrollment.

            We know that a strong STEM education is increasingly being recognized as a path to employment and that the need for STEM knowledge and skills will continue to grow in the future.<sup><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a></sup>            Taking Algebra I in 8th grade can set students up for a strong foundation of STEM education and open the door for various college and career options in STEM. The data explored in this story highlight both successes and areas for improvement,
            as the Department, and districts across the country, work to ensure equal access to a strong STEM education for all students. The disparities found in both access and enrollment warrant closer examination and potential action by all STEM stakeholders.
