            In today’s era of technological innovation, students need to gain knowledge and skills in order to solve difficult problems, gather and evaluate evidence, make sense of information they receive, and be prepared for the workforce and challenges of the
            21<sup>st</sup> century. Students can develop and strengthen these skills by studying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), subjects, including computer science (CS).

          <p>
            Mathematics has been called the “language” of STEM, because students need a strong mathematics foundation to succeed in STEM fields and to make sense of STEM-related topics in their daily lives. This story focuses on K-12 Algebra I because it is seen
            as a gatekeeper course: A student must generally complete Algebra I in order to take higher level mathematics and science courses
            <sup><a
            href="#_ftn2"

            title=""
        >
            [2]
        </a></sup> . Taking the course earlier in their academic careers allows students sufficient time to take the more advanced courses that are often prerequisites for postsecondary STEM majors. However, we see in this data story that
            only 25 percent of all 8<sup>th</sup> graders enrolled in Algebra I. <em>See what the research says about why this matters.</em> #
          </p>
          <p>
            This data story explores both access to and enrollment in Algebra I in K-12 public schools using the 2015–16 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC).
            <sup><a

            [3]
        </a></sup> The data story looks at the types of schools that offer Algebra I classes and further explores the students who actually enroll in these classes, particularly in 8<sup>th</sup> grade. The Department is working to increase
            both access to and enrollment in STEM courses. Both aspects are important because, as we will see through the story, even where access to Algebra I classes is available students do not necessarily enroll in them.

            When students take Algebra I matters, but many students do not have early
            access.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Despite the benefits of early access to Algebra I, we see that only 60 percent of schools that serve 8<sup>th</sup> graders offer Algebra I. A typical math course sequence would start with Algebra I and continue with Geometry, Algebra II,
            Pre-Calculus, and Calculus. Students who do not have access to Algebra I until high school will likely not have the opportunity to take any Calculus courses before they graduate.

            Since high-level mathematics and high-level science courses are frequently taken together, students who have the opportunity to take more advanced math courses are also more likely to take advanced science courses. When schools don’t offer Algebra I to
            8<sup>th</sup> graders, it can reduce the amount of all STEM courses, not just math courses, they can take before graduation.

              Access to Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade is uneven across the country.

          <p>
            Schools that offer Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade provide their students with an opportunity to reach more advanced math and science courses in high school. However, there is a wide variation in students’ access to Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup>            grade based on where the school is located and the type of school they attend. Given the importance of early access to Algebra I, the remainder of this story focuses only on 8<sup>th</sup> grade students and the schools that serve them.

            About 85 percent of students in suburban areas (where the largest percentage of students are enrolled) had access to Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade, compared to about 75 percent of students in all other areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we will explore how <em>access</em> to Algebra I differs from <em>enrollment</em> in Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade.

          <h3>
            Enrollment in Algebra I lags behind access. Even with access, many 8<sup>th</sup> graders are not enrolled.
          </h3>
          <p>
            While access to Algebra I is important, access alone is not enough. Students will not reap the benefits of <em>access</em> to more STEM courses if they are not actually <em>enrolled</em> in the courses.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many factors within a school that may affect how many, and which, students are ultimately enrolled in Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade. For example, some students have access to enroll in Algebra I in 7<sup>th</sup> grade or earlier,
            some may not be ready, and others may not be interested in accelerated mathematics. <em>See what the research says about why this matters.</em> #

            Although over 8,000 districts offered access to Algebra I, in almost 90 percent of districts, less than half of all 8<sup>th</sup> graders were enrolled in the course. We also see differences in enrollment by state, with Minnesota and Pennsylvania,
            for example, standing out as states with broad enrollment. <em>Learn more about how States are focusing on Algebra I</em>.#

            The data explored in this story highlight both successes and areas for improvement, as the Department, and districts across the country, work to ensure equal access to a strong STEM education for all students. The disparities found in both access and
            enrollment warrant closer examination and potential action by all STEM stakeholders.

            <h5>Civil Rights Data Collection</h5>

            <p>
              The data we have explored in this story comes from the <a href="https://ocrdata.ed.gov/">Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)</a>. The CRDC collects a variety of information, including student enrollment and educational programs and services,
              from our nation’s public schools to inform OCR’s work to administer and enforce the civil rights statutes for which it is responsible. It has been collected by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) under the Department of Education since 1968.
              Most of the data collected in the CRDC are disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, English learners, and disability. The CRDC collects data only from public schools and does not include data from private schools.
            </p>

            <h5>Data Exclusion Rules</h5>
            <p>
              Data included in this story may differ slightly from other published reports due to certain data decisions. For the purposes of these analyses, schools with incomplete or inconsistent data values were excluded as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Less than 1% of schools were excluded from all analyses because they reported inconsistent data for Algebra I enrollment for the same grade level.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. An additional 6% of schools serving 8<sup>th</sup> grade students were excluded from all enrollment analyses due to missing 8<sup>th</sup> grade enrollment data or the 8<sup>th</sup> grade Algebra I enrollment count being larger than
              the 8<sup>th</sup> grade overall enrollment.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Less than 10 schools were excluded from the enrollment by urbanicity (locale) analysis due to missing data.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Schools with an 8<sup>th</sup> grade Algebra I enrollment count larger than the 8<sup>th</sup> grade enrollment for either the male or female subgroup (1% of schools serving 8th-grade students) were excluded from the enrollment by gender
              analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. Schools with an 8<sup>th</sup> grade Algebra I enrollment count larger than the 8<sup>th</sup> grade enrollment for at least one race/ethnicity subgroup (16% of schools serving 8<sup>th</sup> grade students) were excluded from the enrollment
              by race/ethnicity analysis.
